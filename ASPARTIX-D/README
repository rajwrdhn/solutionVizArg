README for aspartix argumentation solver. Sarah Gaggl, Norbert Manthey, 2015

ASPARTIX-D

The argumentation solver ASPARTIX-D converts the argumentation problem into ASP
and then solves the ASP with an ASP solver. Some reasoning problems are solved by translating the
ASP program to SAT and then use a SAT solver.

For this purpose, clingo and gringo305/clasp is added to this package. Note, that the license of 
clingo, gringo/clasp is different than the license of ASPARTIX-D (see license.txt). The 
source code of clingo, gringo/clasp can be found at 

http://sourceforge.net/p/potassco/code/HEAD/tree/

For the translations to SAT we use lp2sat and the SAT solver riss.


Statically linked binaries of all used solvers are added for Linux.
