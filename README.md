# solutionVizArg

Navigating through the solution space of an argumentation framework
(AF) is a complex task as the solution space can be extremely large. A
solution for a semantics of an AF is a set of extensions. Each extension
is a subset of arguments following a certain criteria. This project aims at
introducing different ways to visualize all extensions for a semantics of an
AF on a directed graph. The project introduces an interactive tool for
visualization of solutions called solutionVizArg.
